Happy Hours update
==================

## this project is mothballed

We've cancelled Caspio, which drives this project. The master branch here is as it was last published in workign order, but there is also a `mothball` branch that is published to production for users to see that says it no longer exists.

-------------

## Notes about the not-as-old

This is a reworking of the happy hours database on bootstrap, using node and grunt for development. Functionally, it is the same as the old one, [happy-hours-old](https://github.com/statesman/happy-hours-old).

Plan is to move this to Django. Or kill it.

## A note about the old

I created all of this on a branch of [happy-hours-old](https://github.com/statesman/happy-hours-old), but in the end got uncomfortable with the merge conflict and wanted to keep the old version as it was before it was replaced.
